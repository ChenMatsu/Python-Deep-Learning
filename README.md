### CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

#### Filters
Filters are essentially an **Image Kernel**, which is applied to an image, are refered to as **Convolutional Kernels**
The process of passing Filters to Images are called **Convolution**

#### Convolutional Layer
- ANN Issues
  - Large Amount of Params
  - Lost 2D Information by Flatten Data
  - Only Work with Small and Centered Data
---
- CNN 
  - Reduce Params by Local Connectivity 

#### Pooling Layer (Downsampling Layer)
- Max Pooling
- Avg Pooling
- Min Pooling
---
- Dropout Layer
