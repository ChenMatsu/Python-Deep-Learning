### Machine Learning Introduction

- Supervised (Label) => Output is known
  - Classification
  - Regression
- Unsupervised (No Label)
  - Clustering
    - Group Data
  - Anomaly Detection
  - Dimensionality Deduction

---
#### Overfitting / Underfitting
- Overfitting
  - Fits too much noise 
- Underfitting
  - Does not capture trend (Low Variance & High Bias)

---
#### Performace Evaluation (Classification)
- Recall
  - Ability of Model to find relevant cases within datasets 
  - TP / TP + FP
- F1-Score
  - 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)

---
#### Performace Evaluation (Regression)
- MAE
- MSE
- RMSE
